This document does not define an API for QUIC; it instead defines a set of functions for QUIC connections that application protocols can rely upon. An application protocol can assume that an implementation of QUIC provides an interface that includes the operations described in this section. An implementation designed for use with a specific application protocol might provide only those operations that are used by that protocol.

When implementing the client role, an application protocol can:

open a connection, which begins the exchange described in Section 7;
enable Early Data when available; and
be informed when Early Data has been accepted or rejected by a server.
When implementing the server role, an application protocol can:

listen for incoming connections, which prepares for the exchange described in Section 7;
if Early Data is supported, embed application-controlled data in the TLS resumption ticket sent to the client; and
if Early Data is supported, retrieve application-controlled data from the client's resumption ticket and accept or reject Early Data based on that information.
In either role, an application protocol can:

configure minimum values for the initial number of permitted streams of each type, as communicated in the transport parameters (Section 7.4);
control resource allocation for receive buffers by setting flow control limits both for streams and for the connection;
identify whether the handshake has completed successfully or is still ongoing;
keep a connection from silently closing, by either generating PING frames (Section 19.2) or requesting that the transport send additional frames before the idle timeout expires (Section 10.1); and
immediately close (Section 10.2) the connection.
